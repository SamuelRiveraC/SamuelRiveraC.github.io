        <p>  
          I am a Computer Systems Engineer working as a Freelancer since 2017. I've been working remotely with small businesses around the US, Europe, and South America.
        </p>  
        <p>  
          Since I remember I always liked using computers playing videogames, drawing things, and assembling Legos. Eventually, I started to install mods on my videogames and even tweaking bits on a notepad. But it was at college where everything changed, I went to a coding course, and since then there have been very few days where I don't do any code because I love it! 
        </p>  
        <p>  
          Creating solutions to problems, even if they are small things became an infinite source of logical but fun puzzles, and I always love a practical case for the code I develop. I ended up graduating and acquiring my degree in Computer Systems engineering with a profile oriented to analysis, development, and implementation of web systems
        </p>

          Another wish of mine and what drives me forward is that I currently live in Venezuelan and local job offers aren't really fulfilling, and often very "legally flexible" (against the workers, if you catch my drift) so I turned online. Hundred of opportunities appeared and I had to learn how to manage my own time and projects, learn about digital marketing, branding, customer service, and how to sell myself. Before I even realized I was not only a software developer but a businessman; the strategist, the designer, and the developer. 
        </p>  
        <p>  
          Since I am a developer my favorites technologies are WordPress, Laravel, and its JS cousin Adonis; Gatsby, and React and Vue (these pairs do the same but I love both).
        </p>  
        <p>  
          When I'm not developing and building things, you can find me on Youtube learning, training at the gym, learning languages, watching anime, playing videogames, or worldbuilding.
        </p>  
        <p>  
          I'm available for remote full/part-time jobs or contracts. Just Email me at contact@samuelriverac.com or click the contact form below
