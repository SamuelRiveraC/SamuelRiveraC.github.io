# Welcome to my Portfolio Repository

I have developed 4 portfolio sites in the course of 3 years, the first one was made on Laravel, the second one was made on Wordpress, and the last 2 had been made with Gatsby, Easier and cheaper to host, I only need to code and push into the repository and that's it :)

## 🧐 What's inside?

It's very simple, it has 4 pages (Home, About, Contact and Portfolio), different components i often reuse on the pages and a portfolio CRUD powered by Netlify CMS

## 💫 Deploy
